Selenium Hybrid Framework Sample
This project is a sample Selenium Hybrid Framework for automating web and mobile applications using Selenium, Java, Appium, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The framework is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and reusable, enabling automated testing across various platforms with minimal configuration changes

Features
Selenium and Appium Integration: Automate both web and mobile applications using a single framework.
Page Object Model (POM): Enhances test maintenance and readability by separating test scripts from page-specific logic.
Cross-Platform Support: Execute tests on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
Hybrid Framework: Supports data-driven testing with parameterized test data.
Reports: Generates comprehensive test reports for easy analysis of test results.
Logging: Custom logging for better insights into the test execution process.
Framework Structure
The framework is organized into several packages for modularity and readability:

Key Components
Base Classes: Initialize WebDriver and Appium instances, manage configurations, and setup/teardown.
Page Classes: Implement the POM pattern by encapsulating elements and actions for each page or screen.
Utilities: Helper classes for reading data files, generating reports, logging, etc.
Setup
Prerequisites
Java (JDK 11+)
Maven for dependency management
Appium for mobile automation
Node.js and Appium Server (required for mobile tests)
